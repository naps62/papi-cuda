	\begin{itemize}\itemsep=15pt
		\item 3 official profiling methodologies
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Command Line}: Fast to use
				\item \textbf{Visual Profiler}: More user friendly
				\item \textbf{CUPTI}: Full driver access
			\end{itemize}

		\item Each one can have different purposes/applications

		\item Given their purpose, they get the job done

		\item Limitations come mostly from Hardware and/or Driver
	\end{itemize}

	\frametitle{Conclusions - PAPI CUDA}

	\begin{itemize}\itemsep=15pt
		\item Attempt to wrap CUPTI in a known API

		\item Small subset of its features (Callback API seems crutial!)

		\item Will probably fail at profiling asynchronous or multi threaded applications

		\item Still requires CUPTI's help for more complex tasks
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[-] \textit{So why not just use CUPTI instead?}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
