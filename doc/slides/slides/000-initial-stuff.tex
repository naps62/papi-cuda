	\begin{block}{What can be done}
		Gather GPU specific data
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Hardware counters
				\item Global GPU activity
			\end{itemize}

		Analyse and prove code improvements
	\end{block}

	\begin{block}{What can't be done}
		Compare CPU vs GPU implementations (except for global speedups)
	\end{block}

	\begin{block}{Limitations}
		\begin{itemize}%\itemsep=10pt
			\item Several Streaming Multiprocessors, but not all area measured
				% \begin{itemize}
					% \item Before Compute Capability 2.0, only 1 SM was measured
					% \item Later versions measure more than one (but still not all!)
				% \end{itemize}
			\item Harder to profile heterogeneous kernels

			\item Counters have different domains. Results may overlap

			\item Multi-context CUDA apps still lack support
		\end{itemize}
