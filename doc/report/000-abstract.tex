\begin{abstract}
PAPI CUDA presents the CUDA component added to the PAPI library to extend its functionality for massively parallel programs. Many tools already exist in the \nvidia SDK for the purpose of profiling. PAPI CUDA stands as a wrapper for the low-level library CUPTI, which is supposed to aid developers in the deep profiling process.

Tests show that the PAPI library does not provide further functionality over CUPTI and is not easier to use. Compared to the higher level tools, its analysis also stood defective and too complex.
