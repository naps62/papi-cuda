\subsection{Profiling CUDA}
\label{sec:cuda:prof}

Since CUDA 4.0, profiling is done mostly via the CUDA Profiling Tools Interface (CUPTI). This library provides four main API's: Activity, Callback, Event and Metric. These are described in the next sections.

\input{report/321-activity}
\input{report/322-callback}
\input{report/323-event}
\input{report/324-metric}
