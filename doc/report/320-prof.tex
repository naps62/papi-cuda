\subsection{Profiling CUDA}
\label{sec:cuda:prof}

\todo[inline]{Explain (no need for much detail) what can be profiled in a GPU,, how it works, what info can be extracted from the results, and how it differs from CPU profiling. Maybe add subsubsections?}
\todo[inline]{Somewhere in here, talk about built-in profilers, like CUPTI}

Since CUDA 4.0, profiling is done mostly via the CUDA Profiling Tools Interface (CUPTI). These library provides four main API's: Activity, Callback, Event and Metric.

\input{report/321-activity}
\input{report/322-callback}
\input{report/323-event}
\input{report/324-metric}
