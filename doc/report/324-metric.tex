\subsubsection{Metric API}
\label{sec:cuda:prof:metric}

CUPTI's Metric API calculates metrics for each kernel, based on one or more event values. These metrics might be useful to get a higher level overview of the GPU usage and efficiency before having to look at the more raw information provided by the Event API.

Like the Event API, it evolved in version 2.0. Initial versions only provided a small set of metrics:

\begin{description}
	\item[Branch efficiency] Shows the overall ratio of non-divergent branches to total branches, effectively indicating whether or not branching operations are greatly hindering performance.

	\item[Load/Store efficiency] Can be useful to assert if memory accesses are sufficiently coherent to take advantage of memory coalescence.

	\item[Memory Throughput] For metrics indicating effective throughput of memory load/store operations
\end{description}

Compute Capability 2.0, in addition to the previous metrics, provides additional ones:

\begin{description}
	\item[SM Efficiency] Ratio of time at least one warp was active on a multiprocessor to total time

	\item[Occupancy] Ratio of average active warps per active cycle to the maximum amount of warps supported

	\item[IPC] Instructions per Cycle

	\item[Replay overhead] The performance loss due to memory replays

	\item[Cache Hit Rate] Hit rate of L1 cache for both global/local loads and stores

\end{description}
