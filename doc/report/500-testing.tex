%\todo[inline]{Explain the small tests used, to understand the usage of both CUPTI and PAPI-CUDA}

In order to properly perform the comparison to profile CUDA applications, several small tests were performed using PAPI-CUDA and CUPTI. These focused mainly in providing minimal working samples to show the distinction between using each.

Other profiling tools, developed by \nvidia are also discussed in this section and applied to a larger test case. This test case was not developed or had any influence from any of the authors of this document. The limited knowledge over the implemented application is an important factor which prevented conclusions from being instinctively shaped by a prior understanding of the algorithm.
